      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I have been as student at BC on and off for the past few years, but never really known what I want to do. Somehow I stumbled into the idea of taking a programming class last September and found that I was pretty okay at it and I really enjoyed the work!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I have lived on the East-Side my whole life (sans one awkward year at Boise State), it's definitely home and I can't imagine living anywhere else.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My all time favorite time sink is skiing, I've been an avid skiier since I was in second grade and I go as often as possible every year.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Out of High School I thought I wanted to be an airline pilot, but that never really came to be for any number of reasons. I have been all in on Web Development for the past several months and I only love it more every day.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently I live in Woodinville.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Because I believe that if you love what you do you'll never work a day in your life.</p>
